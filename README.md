# Quality of Life Mod

This is a [Hollow Knight: Silksong](https://hollowknightsilksong.com/) mod that removes all waiting.

It uses the [BepInExPack for Silksong](https://thunderstore.io/c/hollow-knight-silksong/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack_Silksong/) to change the functionality of the game.

## Features

### Skip Intro

- Skips the "Team Cherry" splash screen.
- Skips the screen that explains to you what the save indicator means.

### Fast Main Menu

- Makes the menu appear instantly (instead of slowly fading in).
- Makes the save slot screen appear instantly (instead of animating all 4 rectangles one by one).

## Configuration

The mod can be configured by editing the configuration file. By default, it is located at:

```txt
C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\r2modmanPlus-local\HollowKnightSilksong\profiles\Default\BepInEx\config
```
