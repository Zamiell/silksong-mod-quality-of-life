# Quality of Life Mod

This is a [Hollow Knight: Silksong](https://hollowknightsilksong.com/) mod that removes all waiting.

It uses the [BepInExPack for Silksong](https://thunderstore.io/c/hollow-knight-silksong/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack_Silksong/) to load the mod and [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) to change the functionality of the game.

## Features

### Instant Main Menu

- Skips the intro sequence (`Pre_Menu_Intro`).
- Loads the main menu (`Menu_Title`) instantly when you launch the game.
